📊 Predictive Traffic Disruption Analysis (I have more code in my jupyter but it is over 7 millions lines of code my laptop sc=rashed)
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores traffic disruption data to identify patterns and build a foundation for a predictive system that proactively reroutes traffic, reduces congestion, and potentially minimizes accidents. The goal is to use historical data along with weather conditions, event schedules, and sensor input to predict where and when traffic issues are likely to occur.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes:

Traffic incident details (e.g., Severity, Start_Time, End_Time)

Geographic information (e.g., County, State)

Environmental conditions (e.g., Weather_Condition, Temperature(F), Humidity(%))

Sensor-related binary flags (e.g., Traffic_Signal, Junction)

Sample size used: 100 rows
File name: traffic_data_sample.csv

⚙️ Setup & Requirements
To run this notebook, make sure you have the following packages installed:

bash
Копировать
Редактировать
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
📌 Key Steps
Data Loading & Exploration

Load and preview the first 100 rows of the dataset.

Analyze key columns: Severity, Weather_Condition, County, State, Temperature(F).

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.

Convert data types as needed.

Visualization

Severity vs. Weather Conditions.

Heatmaps or bar charts of traffic disruptions by state/county.

Predictive Insights (Planned)

Model future traffic severity using external data such as weather forecasts and event calendars.

Potential integration with live vehicle and sensor data.

🚀 Future Development
Integrate live traffic and weather APIs.

Add a machine learning model for real-time prediction.

Incorporate emergency rerouting recommendations.

Explore sensor-based input (e.g., IoT devices on highways).

🧠 Motivation
The goal of this project is to go beyond reactive responses and provide early warnings and rerouting solutions for high-risk zones. By leveraging data, we aim to improve safety, reduce delays, and inform better infrastructure planning.
